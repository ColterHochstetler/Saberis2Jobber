# Implementation Process

1. **Setting up Environment & Tech Stack:**  
   - Create a virtual environment, set up dependency management, configuration files, and environment variables.
   
2. **Automated Testing Framework:**  
   - Set up unit testing (pytest or similar) so that each subsequent module is covered by tests.
   
3. **Converting XML into Python Object:**  
   - Develop the parser and unit tests for it.
   
4. **Logging Implementation:**  
   - Integrate logging early so that all further development includes traceability and proper error reporting.
   
5. **Connect to Google API:**  
   - Develop and test the Google Sheets connectivity using test credentials.
   
6. **Create the Saberis to Jobber ID Mapping Table:**  
   - Develop functions to fetch, read, and update the mapping table.
   
7. **Develop Checking Functions:**  
   - Create and test functions to verify if a Saberis document has been processed.
   
8. **Create the Function to Create a New Jobber Client if Check Fails:**  
   - Integrate with the Jobber API and update the mapping table.
   
9. **Create Transformation Functions:**  
   - Implement and test the data transformation logic.
   
10. **Create Fail/Retry System:**  
    - Build in the error handling and retry logic, ensuring retries are logged and eventually trigger alerts.
    
11. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Optional but Recommended):**  
    - Integrate your tests and Docker build process into a CI/CD pipeline.
    
12. **Create Docker Image:**  
    - Write and test your Dockerfile, ensuring the container runs the application as expected.
    
13. **Deploy and Run on Cloud:**  
    - Deploy your Docker container to your chosen cloud provider.
    
14. **Create Fail Alert System:**  
    - Integrate email (or other simple) alerting for failures detected by your monitoring/logging.
    
15. **Move from Test to Production Accounts:**  
    - Final testing against production Saberis and Jobber accounts, followed by a go-live plan.

This ordering ensures you build a solid foundation (environment, configuration, logging, testing) before integrating external dependencies and complex error handling. It also keeps testing integral at every step, making it easier to identify and resolve issues early.
