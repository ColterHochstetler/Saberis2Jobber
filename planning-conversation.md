Revised Backend Plan (Supporting the New UI)
First, a quick update to the backend plan to support this UI:

Ingestion Logic: As you said, we'll remove deduplication. Every time the page is loaded (with a 30s cooldown), the app will:
Check a server-side timestamp. If less than 30 seconds have passed since the last ingestion, skip.
Scan example_docs/.
For each file, parse it and add a new record to the saberis_exports.json manifest.
Update the server-side timestamp.
Revised saberis_exports.json Manifest Record: Each record will now contain:
saberis_id: Unique identifier.
stored_path: The path to the stored JSON file.
ingested_at: Server timestamp.
export_date: The "Date" from the Saberis JSON.
customer_name: The "Name" from the "Customer" object.
username: The "Username" from the Saberis JSON.
shipping_address: A formatted string combining Address, City, and StateOrProvince from the "Shipping" object.
sent_to_jobber: A boolean, defaulting to false.
UI Architecture: The Three-Column Responsive Dashboard
The UI will be a single page that presents a clear, step-by-step process from left to right. On wider screens, it will use a three-column layout. On mobile, these columns will stack vertically to ensure usability.

Here is the breakdown of the user's journey across the screen:

Column 1: Select Approved Jobber Quote (Left)
Purpose: The starting point of the workflow.
Appearance: A vertical list of wide, selectable tiles. A "Refresh" button will be in the top right corner of the entire page.
Tile Content: Each tile represents an approved Jobber Quote.
Primary Text (Large): Client Name
Secondary Text (Subtle): Full Address (shipping_address)
Tertiary Info: A placeholder for total quote cost.
Top Right Corner: The date the quote was approved.
Behavior:
This is a single-select list. Clicking a tile makes it the active quote.
The selected tile will have a distinct visual state (e.g., a solid colored border and a slightly different background color).
Crucially, selecting a quote here will trigger the appearance of Column 2.
Column 2: Select Saberis Exports (Center)
Purpose: To associate one or more design exports with the selected Jobber quote.
Appearance: This column is hidden until a Jobber Quote is selected in Column 1. It then appears with a list of available Saberis exports, also as wide tiles.
Tile Content: Each tile represents an ingested Saberis export.
Checkbox: A large, easily clickable checkbox on the far left of the tile.
Primary Text (Large): Customer Name (e.g., "Affinity").
Secondary Text (Subtle): Shipping Address.
Tertiary Info: Username and Export Date (from the JSON).
"Sent" Stamp: If the sent_to_jobber flag in the manifest is true, a large, semi-transparent green "SENT" text is overlaid on the center of the tile, making it clear but not obscuring the content.
Behavior:
This is a multi-select list. Users can check as many boxes as needed.
When a tile's checkbox is ticked, a Quantity Input Box appears to the far right of that specific tile. This box will be empty by default with a subtle red border to draw attention.
Selecting at least one export and filling in the quantity for all selected exports triggers the appearance of Column 3.
Column 3: Actions & Configuration (Right)
Purpose: The final step where the user confirms the action and configures optional parameters.
Appearance: This column is hidden until the conditions in Column 2 are met (at least one item selected and all selected items have a quantity).
Content & Behavior:
"Send Items to Jobber Quote" Button: A large, primary action button. It is the main call to action.
"Configure Surcharges" Button: A secondary button located near the "Send" button. Clicking this does not submit the form but instead reveals the Surcharge Panel directly below it.
The Surcharge Panel (Initially Hidden):
Default Surcharge Field: A number input at the top labeled "Default Surcharge %". Changing this value will dynamically update any catalogue fields below that haven't been manually edited.
Catalogue List: A unique, alphabetized list of all cabinet catalogues from the currently selected Saberis exports. Each item has:
The Catalogue Name (e.g., "KWP_24C1").
A number input field for its specific surcharge, pre-populated with the default value.
Pushback, Simplifications, and Standard Practices
You asked for thoughts on this design. Here are some considerations based on standard UI practices.

Pushback: "Cost" on the Saberis Tile.

You mentioned displaying "cost" on the Saberis tile, but also that "pricing data from saberis is irrelevant" for the final output. Displaying a cost that isn't used might be confusing.
Suggestion: Instead of cost, we can display the Username and Export Date more prominently, as this information helps identify who made the design and when, which is more relevant for selection than a monetary value we are going to ignore.
Simplification: Quantity Input Validation.

The red-outlined empty quantity box is a good visual cue. However, a more standard and less jarring approach is to simply disable the "Send Items to Jobber Quote" button until all selected items have a quantity greater than zero.
Suggestion: We can pair this disabled state with a tooltip that appears on hover, saying "Please enter a quantity for all selected exports." This guides the user without adding potentially alarming colors to the UI.
Standard UI Practice: Loading and Confirmation.

Loading Indicator: When the user clicks the "Refresh" button, we should display a subtle loading spinner to provide feedback that the application is fetching and ingesting new files. This prevents the user from thinking the button is broken.
Confirmation Dialog: Clicking "Send Items to Jobber Quote" is a significant action. We should present a simple confirmation modal (e.g., "Are you sure you want to add [X] items to Jobber Quote [Y]? This action cannot be undone.") to prevent accidental submissions.
Standard UI Practice: Visual Feedback.

Selection State: In addition to the checkbox, the entire tile for a selected Saberis export should change its appearance (e.g., a solid blue border) to make it immediately obvious which items are part of the current operation.
Mobile Responsiveness Strategy
Yes, this design can absolutely be made responsive.

Column Stacking: On a mobile device (or a narrow browser window), the three columns will collapse and stack vertically.
The user first sees the list of Jobber Quotes (Column 1).
Upon selecting one, the list of Saberis Exports (Column 2) appears below it.
Once the conditions are met, the Actions (Column 3) appear at the very bottom of the page.
Tile Design: The wide tiles are well-suited for mobile, as they can simply scale to the width of the screen, with the text content wrapping naturally. This approach avoids horizontal scrolling and provides a clean, top-to-bottom user journey on any device.

I agree with dropping cost on saberis tiles. The cost information is relevant when you're using the surcharge function as a starting place to calculate a quote. But from there it goes through a long process to negotiate the costs with suppliers, etc, before a quote is presented to the client, then negotiated with them, and finally they approve it. Only then will the user go back into our app and repeat their selection to use the "Send Items to Jobber Quote" function. So cost is relevant for the quoting task and stage, but not the Sending to Jobber task and stage. But I still agree with your assessment that it might feel better to skip that. Saberis exports need the information that will best help the user identify it as "the design the just exported", not a full breakdown.


Let's do both red outlines and disabled button. And let's add subtle helper text near the button that says "All designs must have a quantity". I don't want to use a tooltip on hover because of mobile. We'll keep the red outlines because its critical to not fuck this part up, and it's easy to do.



Yes to confirmation dialog.



Agreed with selection state.
