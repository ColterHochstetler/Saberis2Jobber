Below is the detailed documentation of the planned tech stack for the Saberis-to-Jobber integration project:

---

## Pla;nned Tech Stack Overview

### 1. **Programming Language & Runtime**

- **Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.9 or later):**  
  Provides a modern language with a rich ecosystem and libraries ideal for rapid development and maintenance.
- **Virtual Environment:**  
  Use virtualenv or Python’s built-in venv to isolate dependencies and manage packages via a `requirements.txt` file.

---

### 2. **Core Libraries and Frameworks**

#### HTTP & API Integration

- **Requests:**  
  To handle HTTP calls to the Saberis API for fetching XML exports and to the Jobber API for creating clients and quotes.

- **Retry Logic:**  
  Use Python’s built‑in retry patterns or a library like **Tenacity** to implement a controlled retry mechanism for transient API failures.

#### XML Parsing

- **xml.etree.ElementTree or lxml:**  
  For parsing and converting Saberis XML exports into Python objects for further transformation.

#### Scheduling

- **APScheduler:**  
  To run a scheduled task that polls the Saberis API every 30 seconds. This keeps the solution flexible for future adjustments.

#### Logging

- **Python’s Logging Module:**  
  Implement file and console logging with timestamps. This provides basic monitoring and traceability throughout the application’s workflow.

#### Google Sheets Integration

- **gspread & google-auth:**  
  To connect with the Google Sheets API for maintaining a client mapping table (Saberis client names to Jobber client IDs).  
  This setup offers human readability and ease of management for non-technical users.

#### Email Alerts

- **smtplib:**  
  To send email alerts when the system exhausts its retry attempts after a failure. This provides a simple notification mechanism for errors.

---

### 3. **Data Transformation & Mapping**

- **Custom Transformation Functions:**  
  Create dedicated modules for transforming the parsed XML data into the format expected by Jobber’s API.  
- **Mapping Table Management:**  
  Read and update a Google Sheets table that stores Saberis client names mapped to Jobber client IDs.  
  Automatically create a new Jobber client when a mapping isn’t found and update the sheet accordingly.

---

### 4. **Error Handling & Monitoring**

- **Retry Mechanism:**  
  Implement a retry system (with libraries like Tenacity or custom logic) to handle API errors gracefully.
- **Logging & Basic Health Checks:**  
  Use the logging module for error tracking and to record the status of each operation.  
  Optionally, implement minimal health checks (e.g., simple endpoint or log-based alerts) when running in a cloud environment.

---

### 5. **Testing**

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Utilize **pytest** to develop unit tests for individual modules (XML parsing, API integrations, transformation functions, etc.).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Validate end-to-end flows (e.g., from Saberis XML fetch to Jobber API call) using sandbox/test accounts.
- **Dry-Run Mode:**  
  Optionally, include a mode to perform transformations without affecting live Jobber data, which can help during testing phases.

---

### 6. **Containerization and Deployment**

- **Docker:**  
  - **Base Image:** Use a lightweight base image such as `python:3.9-slim` to keep the container efficient.
  - **Dockerfile:** Define steps to install dependencies (using `requirements.txt`), copy the application code, and set the container’s entrypoint to run the polling script.
- **Deployment on Cloud:**  
  Run the Docker container on a cloud provider that supports containerized deployments (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure).  
  This setup will run continuously (25/7) and can be monitored via basic log outputs and health checks.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (Optional):**  
  Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building the Docker image, and deployment processes.

---

### 7. **Configuration & Secret Management**

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Securely store API tokens, email credentials, and other sensitive configuration using environment variables.
- **Configuration Files:**  
  Use simple configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON) for non-sensitive settings such as polling intervals and endpoints.  
  This allows for easy updates without code changes.

---

### 8. **Development and Deployment Process**

- **Development Stages:**  
  The project is broken down into clear stages (environment setup, XML conversion, logging, Google API integration, mapping table creation, checking functions, transformation, retry mechanisms, Docker image creation, cloud deployment, alert system, and production move) with testing at each step.
- **Documentation and Comments:**  
  Maintain clear documentation and inline code comments throughout development to support future maintenance and troubleshooting.

This tech stack is designed to keep the solution simple and maintainable while providing a robust foundation for integrating Saberis and Jobber. It supports rapid development, secure configurations, error resilience, and straightforward deployment in a cloud environment using Docker.
