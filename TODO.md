OVERALL USE CASE:
- S2B is used after a job is approved, appending to existing quote to act as inventory management

# TODO:
- CHECK IF LINE ID 3 is always door style, if so add to description
- Keep L/R, strip out brackets in the title.
- Check how 2 different catelogs are represented. Door styles might change between.
- Investigate color
- Create a catalog code-to-human brand name. System populated catalog codes if an entry isn't found, and uses brand name only if its found, otherwise continues using catalog code.
- Test modifying a cabinet (double click cabinet, select add-ons) to see how that is trackable

Line item names = Brand/CatalogCode, Cabinet code, Door Style, Color 



NEED:
How do users indicate when a quote needs line items?
How do they associate the two
