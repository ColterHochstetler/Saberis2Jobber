# CRITICAL ITEMS
- For "SendToJobber", pass in COGS as cost, and 0 as price.
- Fix type errors in Saberis_ingestion
- Test storing/recalling/deleting saberis data in google sheets
- Adjust UI for single task, selecting jobber quote/job last. 
  - determine where to place quote total and "send to jobber" buttons, maybe top bar?

# REMAINING ITEMS
- Tell users if saberis check fails/succeeds
- Check what fields need to be filled for name 
- Break mod codes up into mod N. Keep code in jobber name, and then put the "Mod N: #####" into the description itself.

- Inform user when saberis auth fails

## VOLUME

Volume should be sensitive to the "ignore catalog" function. Simply sum and display if >0
